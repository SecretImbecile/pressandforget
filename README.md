# Press and Forget
A minimal WordPress theme.

## Features
### Simple responsive design
The theme is built with CSS flexboxes, so scales well between desktop and mobile formats without a huge number of media queries.

### Print formatting
The theme even has print specific formatting, so in the unlikely event somebody decides to print a website out, they'll get well typeset serif text.
