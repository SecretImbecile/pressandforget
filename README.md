# Press and Forget
A minimal WordPress theme.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecretImbecile/pressandforget/raw/master/screenshot.jpg "")

## Features
### Simple responsive design
The theme is built with CSS flexboxes, so scales well between desktop and mobile formats without a huge number of media queries.

### Focus on readability
Page body is sized relative to font size, maintaining approximately 75 characters per line for best readability. A contrasting font colour is used along with a large default font size.

### Light on features
With so little of WordPress's theme features enabled, there's hardly anything to go wrong!

### Custom print formatting
I know, nobody prints web pages. Just in case they do, they'll get nicely typeset serif text.
